# ez_package.use
## Compiling:
The only requirements to compile this program yourself is GCC.
run
```bash
make
```
to compile the program. It will output a binary called "ezpackageuse"

## Why?
I personally found it was a bit annoying to have to create the file in the package.use directory myself and add the values in their manually. So I just wanted to make a tool where i can just copy paste what portage outputs and have it automatically add the USE flags to package.use. I hope others can find this program useful as well.
